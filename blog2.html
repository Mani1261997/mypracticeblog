                           <p class="blog__p">In this quote, Einstein tries to explain his genius. He says that he has no special talents. While there are many theories on that portion of the quote, some of the leading explanations include how ‘folded’ his brain was, where some of the folds were (or were not), and how he used his brain (visual thinking vs verbal thinking). See Einstein’s Brain for more details.</p>
                           <p class="blog__p">However his brain might have been formed, and whatever talents it may have given him, the second part of the quote is rock solid. He was passionately curious. When coupled with a keen intellect and an unwillingness to let a problem sit unfinished, the result is practically unstoppable.</p>
                           <p class="blog__p">While there is only one Einstein, and while he is one of the measuring sticks still used today for determining brilliance (as in “yeah, he’s bright, but he’s no Einstein”), we all can have our moments. By being curious, we learn. By being passionately curious, we continue to learn, and become even more curious.</p>
                           <p class="blog__p">We become even more curious because, like fractals, the closer you look, the more there is to see. Every answer raises a new question. We only stop being curious when we cease being passionate about the topic. While a passionate curiosity about everything will take up all you time, having a topic or two you stay curious about is a great way to keep your mind active and the learning centers of your brain open for business.</p>
